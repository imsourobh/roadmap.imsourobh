    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard with four primary navigation tabs corresponding to the learning phases (Foundation, CTF Practice, Bug Bounty, Professional Transition). This phased approach prevents information overload by allowing users to focus on one stage at a time. Within each phase, weeks are presented as interactive cards. Clicking a card dynamically populates a detailed view with a checklist, project goals, and a time commitment chart. This design was chosen to make the dense, linear information of the 32-week report highly scannable, interactive, and less intimidating for the user, promoting a clear, step-by-step exploration of the learning journey. Supplemental sections for 'Key Skills' and 'Tool Arsenal' are included to provide crucial context without cluttering the main roadmap flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Key Skills; Goal -> Organize; Viz/Presentation -> Radar Chart; Interaction -> Hover tooltips; Justification -> A radar chart effectively visualizes the multi-faceted nature of a pentester's skill set, showing the balance between technical and soft skills better than a list. Library/Method -> Chart.js. Report Info -> Time Allocation per week; Goal -> Compare; Viz/Presentation -> Bar Chart; Interaction -> None; Justification -> A simple bar chart provides a quick, visual comparison of the weekly time commitment. Library/Method -> Chart.js. Report Info -> PTES Phases; Goal -> Organize; Viz/Presentation -> HTML/CSS Diagram; Interaction -> Click to highlight; Justification -> A clean, structured HTML layout effectively represents a process flow without needing external libraries or SVG graphics. Report Info -> Tool list; Goal -> Inform; Viz/Presentation -> Grid of cards; Interaction -> None; Justification -> A card-based gallery is a modern and scannable way to present the tool arsenal. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
